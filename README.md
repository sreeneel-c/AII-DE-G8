GreenMind DataForge

GreenMind DataForge is an Artificial Intelligence–driven data engineering platform focused on building intelligent, scalable, and automated data pipelines for environmental and sustainability-oriented data. The system ingests raw data from diverse sources such as sensors, logs, and structured datasets, then applies AI and machine learning techniques to clean, transform, enrich, and analyze the data efficiently.

By integrating modern data engineering practices with intelligent analytics, GreenMind DataForge enables reliable data processing, anomaly detection, and insight generation that support smarter decision-making. The project emphasizes modular pipeline design, automation, and performance optimization, making it suitable for real-world AI-powered data engineering workflows in sustainability and green technology domains.
